							<h3>Just a little bite...</h3>
							<p>The earliest rubber ducks were made from harder rubber when manufacturers began using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear">Charles Goodyear's</a> invention, <strong>vulcanized rubber</strong>. Consequently, these solid rubber ducks were not capable of floating and were instead <strong>intended as chew toys.</strong></p>

							<p>Sculptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ganine">Peter Ganine</a> created a sculpture of a duck in the 1940s. He then patented it and reproduced it as a floating toy, of which over 50 million were sold.</p>

							<h3>A bird with many faces</h3>
							<p>Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous novelty variations on the basic theme, including character ducks representing professions, politicians, or celebrities. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, quack, change color, have interior LED illumination, or include a wind-up mechanism that enables them to "swim".</p>
